        Why do I have to pay to use {{config.siteTitle}}?

Maintaining {{config.siteTitle}} and adding new features comes at a
cost. We do not sell your data to advertisers and other third parties.
We charge you a small fee and provide you with great service, new
features, and support in return. You can cancel anytime � no limitations.

{{params.destination}} Emails will be permanently removed from your
account and cannot be restored. Emails will be moved to the 'Trash'
folder. Emails will be removed from your Inbox, but will be visible in
"All Mail" folder and in {{config.siteTitle}}. Other labels will remain
intact. Emails will be moved to the "Archive" folder but will still be
visible in {{config.siteTitle}}. Emails will be labeled as 'Read Later'
and removed from your Inbox. Emails will be moved to a 'Read Later'
folder. You will receive a summary of emails in 'Read Later' every
{{window.digestTimeframeNames[account.readlater_digest]}}. You can
change this in Settings. All existing and new emails matching the rule
will be moved to Trash by an Auto Clean rule.

You can clean
{{(config.trial+account.entitlements.account.trial_expansion).toLocaleString()}} emails for free.
You already cleaned
{{parseInt(account.entitlements.account.trial_used).toLocaleString()}}.

Invite your friends to {{config.siteTitle}} //

And clean more emails for free!

We're sorry to see you go but we understand sometimes things don't work
out. Please help us improve � why are you canceling?
Missing important emails!

{{config.siteTitle}} only deletes, archives, or labels emails as
instructed in Auto Clean and Unsubscriber rules. If you believe you are
missing important emails please take a look at your Auto Clean and Smart
Unsubscriber rules and make sure you do not have overly "broad" rules
like "Move to Trash all emails in Inbox" or similar. Read more about it
here.

Please note, cancelling your subscription *will not* immediately stop
Auto Clean rules � they will work until the end of the billing period.
Please get in touch with our support team for help with your Auto Clean
rules.

Too slow!

We get it � and we are as frustrated as you are! Unfortunately, most of
the speed related issues are not something we can solve since we fully
rely on your email provider.

All email providers have different kinds of requirements and
limitations. They usually limit the amount of emails that can be
processed in a single batch, as well as the number of emails that can be
processed in a given period of time. Read more about it here.

Too expensive

We did our best to price {{config.siteTitle}} to be as affordable for
everyone as possible � but building a secure service comes at a cost. To
maintain security of your data, Clean Email is hosted at the highest
tier datacenter, passes mandatory annual security audits, and is
regularly reviewed by security and privacy consultants. Subscription
payments is our only source of income � we do not sell your data and do
not advertise to you.

Please consider switching to a different plan:

Switch

$*.** / month (one payment of $**.** /
{{(account.entitlements.plans[upgrades.selectedUpgradePlan].every > 1 ?
account.entitlements.plans[upgrades.selectedUpgradePlan].every : '')}}
{{account.entitlements.plans[upgrades.selectedUpgradePlan].interval}}{{Utils.pluralize(account.entitlements.plans[upgrades.selectedUpgradePlan].every, '', 's')}})

Don't like subscriptions

We get it � but most of our features require ongoing maintenance,
updates, and incur infrastructure costs. For example, to enable Auto
Clean and Unsubscriber we maintain a connection to your mailbox,
regularly query your email service for new and updated emails, or rely
on your email server notifying us about changes to your mailbox. Once an
update is received we evaluate every new and updated email to match it
with your Auto Clean or Unsubscriber rules and then apply actions you
have chosen to apply.

{{config.siteTitle}}'s servers are up and running 24/7 evaluating
thousands of new emails per minute to ensure that unwanted emails do not
stay in your Inbox, labels are applied, and emails are moved.

Does not solve my problem or lacks features I am looking for

We're sorry that {{config.siteTitle}} did not live up to your
expectations. We'd appreciate if you share your expectations with us so
we can add the features you are looking for.

Difficult to use

We're sorry that {{config.siteTitle}} was not as easy to use as you
expected. We suggest checking out our help section before making the
final decision. If you'd still like to cancel we'd appreciate if you
share your feedback with us so we can improve.

Does not work

We're sorry that {{config.siteTitle}} is not functioning properly.
Please give us a chance to fix it before you cancel � describe the
problem you are having and we will fix it right away.

Not comfortable with a third party having access to my email account
We share your concerns and that's why security and privacy of your data
is our first priority. {{config.siteTitle}} is one of the very few
companies on the market not sharing your data with third parties. This
was verified by Google as part of their verification program. Security
of our service, infrastructure, and procedures were verified and
independently tested by a certified third parties, Leviathan Security
Group and BishopFox. We are a small and honest company and we're in
business to provide you with great service and protect your data.
Nothing is wrong, I don�t need it anymore
Other

We're sorry that {{config.siteTitle}} did not live up to your
expectations. We'd appreciate if you share your feedback with us so we
can improve.

Still would like to cancel?
Proceed

Once your subscription is deactivated {{automation.cnt}} Auto Clean
rules (helped you clean {{automation.processed}} emails) and
{{unsubscriber.counters.unsubscribe}} Unsubscriber rules (helped you
clean {{unsubscriber.counters.prevented}} emails) will stop working.

Cancel your Subscription

Your subscription will be cancelled immediately but you can still use
all features of {{config.siteTitle}} until the end of the billing
period. You will not be charged again.
